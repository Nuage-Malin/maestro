## DevOps

GitHub actions are executed when pushing on branch main and develop,
they :

- ensure compilation as succeeded
- reformat and lint code
- reformat cmake files
- generate documentation
- execute functional and unit tests
- protect from pushing on branch main (should use pull requests instead)

When reformatting, it commits and pushes on the same branch you pushed,
therefore, you may need to pull before pushing again.

## Code formatting with `clang-format`

A ***.clang-format*** file exists at the root of this directory, you **should** configure your IDE to format your code
according to its rules.

If you do not apply the last recommendation, before committing your
changes, you must execute :

```sh
mkdir "build"
cmake -S . -B build
make clang-format -C build ## call the rule clang-format on the Makefile generated by cmake
```
